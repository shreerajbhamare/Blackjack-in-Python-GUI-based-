A standard deck of playing cards has four suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Spades and Clubs) and thirteen ranks (2 through 10, then the face cards Jack, Queen, King and Ace) for a total of 52 cards per deck. Jacks, Queens and Kings all have a rank of 10. Aces have a rank of either 1 or 11 as needed to reach 21 without busting.

## Description

**Basic Blackjack Rules:**
           - The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
           - Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.
           - Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.
           - To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.
           - If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
           - If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack.
           - Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher.
           - Split can be done when you have two of the same card - the pair is split into two hands.
           - You can only double/split on the first move, or first move of a hand created by a split.
           - You cannot play on two aces after they are split.
